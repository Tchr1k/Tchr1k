# Hi There

I am a Front-End Developer with experience in building responsive and user-friendly web applications. I am skilled in HTML and CSS, allowing me to create clean, visually appealing layouts, and I also have experience with Python, which I use for backend support, automation, and scripting. I enjoy turning design ideas into functional, interactive websites and continuously improving my coding skills to stay up-to-date with modern web development practices.
